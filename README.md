# LogoDetection

This Project demonstrates the Real time detectiog Logos.Logos sometimes also known as trademark have high importance in todayâ€™s marketing world. Products, companies and different gaming leagues are often recognized by their respective logos. Logo recognition in images and videos is the key problem in a wide range of applications, such as copyright infringement detection, vehicle logo for intelligent traffic-control systems, augmented reality, contextual advertise placement and others. In this post we will look on how to use SSD from Tensorflow API to detect as well as localize brand logos ,For a small demo I am using Nike Logo Detection.

# TensorFlow Object Detection API

. The [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.
