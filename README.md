# LogoDetection

This Project demonstrates the Real time detectiog Logos.Logos sometimes also known as trademark have high importance in today’s marketing world. Products, companies and different gaming leagues are often recognized by their respective logos. Logo recognition in images and videos is the key problem in a wide range of applications, such as copyright infringement detection, vehicle logo for intelligent traffic-control systems, augmented reality, contextual advertise placement and others. In this post we will look on how to use SSD from Tensorflow API to detect as well as localize brand logos ,For a small demo I am using Nike Logo Detection.

# TensorFlow Object Detection API

. The [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.
If you don’t have the Tensorflow Object Detection API installed yet you can watch my tutorial on it.
The steps needed are:

Gathering data

Labeling data

Generating TFRecords for training

Configuring training

Training model

Exporting inference graph

Testing object detector

# Create your own DataSet

Data augmentation is an automatic way to boost the number of different images you will use to train your Deep learning        algorithms.To perform well, an image classifier needs a lot of images to train on. Deep learning algorithms can fail to classify , only because some object are oriented differently on your test images.
So you can Create your own DataSet,I have written a small blog have a look .
